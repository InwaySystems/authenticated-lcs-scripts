# Authenticated Scripts

Use a [service connection][serviceConnection] with scripts instead of pasting secrets into variables!

### ‚ùó *Important note on using Service Connections* ‚ùó

Please note that these tasks are built to only use `Generic` Service Connections. No other connections will be displayed when configuring these tasks. This is due to how Service Connections function in Azure DevOps- `Generic` is a "well-known" connection type as it is built into the platform, and thus can be reliably referenced by these tasks üôÇ 

Please see the following GitHub Issue if more detail is needed: [LINK](https://github.com/cloudpups/authenticated-scripts/issues/5)

## Features

* ‚úÖ Supply Generic Service Connection to a PowerShell script
* ‚úÖ Supply Generic Service Connection to a Bash script

## How

![A screenshot showing the service connection exposed as environment variables](/docs/highlighted_env.png)

This task injects the values of a Generic Service Connection into the current environment so that the specified script may utilize them. The values of the Generic Service Connection are mapped to environment variables as follows:

| Service Connection Variable | Environment Variable |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| url                         | AS_SC_URL            |
| username                    | AS_SC_USERNAME       |
| password                    | AS_SC_PASSWORD       |

Please note that this task does **not** persist the environment variables for longer than the execution of the script itself.

### A note on acronyms

`AS_SC_` (i.e. *Authenticated Shell Service Connection*) is prepended to the environment variable names to reduce the chance of collisions.

## Example

Please note that `serviceConnection: 'Testing Authenticated Shell'` was configured with a [Service Connection][serviceConnection]. 

```yml
steps:
- task: AuthenticatedPowerShell@1  
  inputs:
    serviceConnection: 'Testing Authenticated Shell'
    targetType: inline
    script: 'Write-Host "url: $env:AS_SC_URL | username: $env:AS_SC_USERNAME | password: $env:AS_SC_PASSWORD"'
- task: AuthenticatedBash@1  
  inputs:
    serviceConnection: 'Testing Authenticated Shell'
    targetType: inline
    script: 'echo "Hello $AS_SC_URL $AS_SC_USERNAME $AS_SC_PASSWORD"'     
```

## Motivation

Long story short, no other extension allowed one to use Generic Service Connections with a custom script.

---

There are many tasks today that ship with Service Connections so that users of Azure DevOps can connect to secured resources in a consistent and auditable fashion. With enough usage of Azure DevOps, one is sure to come across a scenario that does not yet have a corresponding task. There are two options to proceed with at this point:

1. Write a custom task/extension.
2. Write a script until a task/extension can be made.

As creating (and *maintaining*) a custom task is a non-trivial effort, many folks opt for writing and executing a script (e.g. Bash or PowerShell). Unfortunately, as of the initial writing of this, no other tasks existed that allowed a script to access Service Connections in a consistent and secure fashion. Thus this extension was created- so that scripts can utilize Service Connections in a consistent fashion.

So why not simply use private variables (as some answers to "How to use a Service Connection in a Script" suggest)? This could boil down to preference, but Service Connections offer a variety of benefits over using variables (e.g. update once and use across many pipelines, approvals and checks, etc).
